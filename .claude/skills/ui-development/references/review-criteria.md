# Visual Review Criteria

## Accessibility

- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text)
- [ ] Focus indicators visible (2px outline, distinct color)
- [ ] Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- [ ] Text readable at default zoom

## Dark Mode

- [ ] All backgrounds respond to `dark:` variants
- [ ] Text colors adapt (light text on dark backgrounds)
- [ ] Border colors adjust
- [ ] Hover/focus states work in both modes
- [ ] Icons and graphics visible

## Visual Consistency

- [ ] Spacing follows Tailwind scale (2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24...)
- [ ] Colors from project palette (beige-50/100/200/300, amber-600/700)
- [ ] Typography sizes consistent (text-sm, text-base, text-lg, text-xl, text-2xl)
- [ ] Border radius consistent (rounded, rounded-lg, rounded-xl)

## Typography

- [ ] Line heights comfortable (leading-tight for headings, leading-relaxed for body)
- [ ] Font weights appropriate (font-medium for emphasis, font-semibold for headings)
- [ ] Text-background contrast good in both themes

## Avoid Generic AI Aesthetics

- [ ] No purple gradients on white
- [ ] No overused system fonts (Inter/Roboto/Arial) - project uses Inter intentionally
- [ ] No cookie-cutter layouts
- [ ] Context-specific, polished design
