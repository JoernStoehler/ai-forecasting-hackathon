## Abstract
Summarize your project in 2–4 sentences. Highlight the problem, your approach, and the headline outcome.

## Introduction
Write your research question(s) and hypotheses here. Give your free-form writeup of how your work contributes and what your project has been all about! This also provides the answers to multiple questions in the jury evaluation criteria, such as the relevance to the field, the potential impact, and the threat model you work with.

## Methods
Write about the methods, code, and Github repositories you made along the way. What type of model did you train, what were your methods, how did you find your way.

## Results
Showcase and explain your results here. This is where you include the graphs, screenshots, visualizations, and statistical results from your research.

## Discussion and Conclusion
This is where you can include all the wonderful explanations, discussions, results, analyses, statistics, and much more.
Let’s add a few citations: (Alon, 2006; Goh et al., 2021; Lindner et al., 2023; Olah et al., 2020; Weiss et al., 2021). Here, we use the Zotero software with the Zotero add-on for Chrome and Google Docs for citation management but you can also write them manually (for significantly more hassle).
