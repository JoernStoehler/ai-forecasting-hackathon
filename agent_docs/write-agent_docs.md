# Write agent_docs
<!-- REVIEW: house style sanity check. -->
- Keep pages short (<1 screen) and focused on non-obvious tasks.
- Prefer concrete commands over prose; avoid repeating `AGENTS.md` or common sense.
- Name files by task (`add-git-worktree.md`, `run-checks.md`) and keep them at `agent_docs/`.
